# - Compile stub BPF programs to be integrated into a target
#
# This function performs a multi-steps process to compile BPF programs and
# make them available to a C binary:
#   1. Compile the C BPF programs into an ELF file using clang.
#   2. Use xxd to generate a C source file containing two symbols: an array of
#      bytes defining the ELF file, and an integer to define its length.
#   3. Generate a header file declaring an array of custom structures
#      representing all the ELF stubs available.
#
# Each generated C source file is added to the target as a dependency *but not
# compiled*. The generated header in step 3 will include those header files
# directly.
#
# Params:
#   - TARGET: name of the target to define stubs for.
#   - DIR: directory containing the source files for the stubs.
#   - SYM_PREFIX: prefix of the C symbols.
#   - DECL_HDR_PATH: path to the generated header file. The caller is
#     responsible for adding the containing directory to the list of include
#     directory for the taret.
#   - STUBS: list of strings defining the name of the stubs sources.
#     bf_target_add_elfstubs() will look for the stubs following the pattern:
#     ${DIR}/${STUB_NAME}.bpf.c.
