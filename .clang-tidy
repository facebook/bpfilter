# All generic Clang-Tidy check are enabled by default, meaning project-specific
# checks are disabled. From there, unrelevant checks are disable on a
# check-by-check basis.
#
# Disabled checks:
# - bugprone-assignment-in-if-condition
#   Very carefully used, but useful when reading a bf_marsh.
# - bugprone-easily-swappable-parameters
#   Too many false positives, especially when swapable arguments are of different
#   types (which will be flagged by the compiler).
# - cert-dcl37-c
#   Handled by bugprone-reserved-identifier.AllowedIdentifiers.
# - cert-dcl51-cpp
#   Handled by bugprone-reserved-identifier.AllowedIdentifiers.
# - cert-int09-c
#   See readibility-enum-initial-value
# - clang-analyzer-core.CallAndMessage
#   Too many false positives with GCC statement expressions.
# - clang-analyzer-deadcode.DeadStores
#   False positives when a bf_jmpctx with cleanup attribute is defined (but
#   not initialized) and initialized later on.
# - clang-analyzer-optin.core.EnumCastOutOfRange
#   We need to use negative enum values to refer to specific counters (errors
#   and policy), while the positive values refers to the counters. We can't
#   create an enum value for every possible counter index, so clang-tidy will
#   complain the value doesn't exist. Which is true. But it's expected.
# - clang-analyzer-security.insecureAPI.DeprecatedOrUnsafeBufferHandling
#   Avoid usage of Annex K functions for portability reasons.
# - clang-analyzer-unix.Malloc
#   Generates false positives.
# - modernize-macro-to-enum
#   No benefit.
# - modernize-use-trailing-return-type
#   No benefit.
# - performance-no-int-to-ptr
#   No benefit.
# - readability-enum-initial-value
#   clang-tidy complains because the X_MAX value of the enums is not defined
#   explicitly, while other are. We prefer to do it this way.
# - readability-function-cognitive-complexity
#   Functions generating BPF bytecode will trigger this rule anytime, but they're
#   not that complex due to heavy use of macros.
# - readability-isolate-declaration
#   Rely on manual check: it's uncommon in bpfilter for multiple variable to be
#   defined on a single line, but it's sometimes for the better.
# - readability-suspicious-call-argument
#   Raises non-issues.

  # Allow use of reserved identifiers as long as they start with "_bf",
  # "_BF", or "_cleanup". This check has been modified starting with
  # clang-tools-extra v18 (https://releases.llvm.org/18.1.0/tools/clang/tools/extra/docs/ReleaseNotes.html#improvements-to-clang-tidy)
  # and will behave differently for macros. Hence clang-tidy v18+ won't
  # warn about _cleanup_ identifiers.
