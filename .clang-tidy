# Disable checks:
# - bugprone-reserved-identifier:
#   Functions starting with `_[A-Z]` are flagged as erroneous, but it's valid in C.
# - bugprone-suspicious-include:
#   Not a huge issue, and leading to false positive as unit tests include the tested
#   C file.
# - bugprone-assignment-in-if-condition:
#   Assignment in if conditions sometimes make the code simpler and shorter. However,
#   they should be used sparingly.
# - bugprone-macro-parentheses
#   This must not be enforced, as it would break macros using a parameter's content
#   as a type name for example.
# - bugprone-easily-swappable-parameters
#   More noisy than necessary.
# - clang-analyzer-security.insecureAPI.DeprecatedOrUnsafeBufferHandling:
#   Warn on occurrences of unsafe or deprecated buffer handling functions, but
#   requires usage of optional component of the C language.
# - readability-function-cognitive-complexity
#   This is getting in the way too often.
