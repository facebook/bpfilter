# All generic Clang-Tidy check are enabled by default, meaning project-specific
# checks are disabled. From there, unrelevant checks are disable on a
# check-by-check basis.
#
# Disabled checks:
# - bugprone-assignment-in-if-condition
#   Very carefully used, but useful when reading a bf_marsh.
# - bugprone-easily-swappable-parameters
#   Too many false positives, especially when swapable arguments are of different
#   types (which will be flagged by the compiler).
# - cert-dcl37-c
#   Handled by bugprone-reserved-identifier.AllowedIdentifiers.
# - cert-dcl51-cpp
#   Handled by bugprone-reserved-identifier.AllowedIdentifiers.
# - clang-analyzer-security.insecureAPI.DeprecatedOrUnsafeBufferHandling
#   Avoid usage of Annex K functions for portability reasons.
# - clang-analyzer-unix.Malloc
#   Generates false positives.
# - modernize-macro-to-enum
#   No benefit.
# - readability-function-cognitive-complexity
#   Functions generating BPF bytecode will trigger this rule anytime, but they're
#   not that complex due to heavy use of macros.
# - readability-isolate-declaration
#   Rely on manual check: it's uncommon in bpfilter for multiple variable to be
#   defined on a single line, but it's sometimes for the better.
