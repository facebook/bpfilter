Inspect counters and logs
=========================

Is your chain doing what you expect? Counters will tell you how often a rule matched, and logs will show you what it matched.

Read the counters
-----------------

Let's use the chain created in :doc:`block-addresses` as an example:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ sudo bfcli chain get --name block_sources
    chain block_sources BF_HOOK_TC_INGRESS{ifindex=2} ACCEPT
        counters policy 8 packets 628 bytes; error 0 packets 0 bytes
        set blocklist (ip4.saddr) in {
            192.0.2.1
            192.0.2.2
        }
        rule
            (ip4.saddr) in blocklist
            counters 3 packets 294 bytes
            DROP

``bfcli`` will print a ``counters`` line for every rule defined with ``counter``, with the number of packets and bytes matched by the rule. The chain also has two counters of its own: one for the packets that reached the policy, and one for the packets it failed to process. If you don't know which rule matches your traffic, print the chain before and after sending it, and see which counter went up.

If you want to print all your chains at once, use ``sudo bfcli ruleset get``. Both commands accept ``--no-set-content``, which helps when large sets make the output unreadable.

Log the packets
---------------

Add ``log`` to the rule you are interested in. For example, edit ``block_sources.bf`` to log the packets dropped by our chain:

.. code-block:: text

    chain block_sources BF_HOOK_TC_INGRESS{ifindex=2} ACCEPT
        set blocklist (ip4.saddr) in { 192.0.2.1; 192.0.2.2 }
        rule
            (ip4.saddr) in blocklist
            log internet every 1s
            counter
            DROP

``log internet`` will log the layer 3 header of the packet, and ``every 1s`` limits the rule to one log entry per second. If you changed the blocklist with ``chain update-set``, update the set in the file too: ``chain update`` will replace the content of the set with the one in the file.

Validate the chain, then update it:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ bfcli chain update --from-file block_sources.bf --dry-run
    warning: Hook options are ignored when updating a chain
    info   : --dry-run used, chain not updated
    $ sudo bfcli chain update --from-file block_sources.bf
    warning: Hook options are ignored when updating a chain

``bfcli`` warns you that the hook options are ignored: the chain stays attached, but its counters are reset (see :doc:`update-chain`).

Read the logs
-------------

.. code-block:: shell

    $ sudo bfcli chain logs --name block_sources

    [17:47:28.387499] Rule #0 matched 98 bytes with verdict DROP
      IPv4      : 192.0.2.1       → 192.0.2.100     [icmp, TTL=64]

    [17:47:29.619157] Rule #0 matched 98 bytes with verdict DROP
      IPv4      : 192.0.2.1       → 192.0.2.100     [icmp, TTL=64]

    [17:47:30.835091] Rule #0 matched 98 bytes with verdict DROP
      IPv4      : 192.0.2.1       → 192.0.2.100     [icmp, TTL=64]
    ^C

``bfcli`` will print the log entries as they are published by the chain, so send some traffic from a blocked address while it runs. Every entry contains the index of the rule, its verdict, and the headers you requested. Hit ``Ctrl+C`` to quit: the chain keeps filtering.

If you don't need the full headers, ``log 5-tuple`` will print the addresses, ports, and protocol on a single line, but only for TCP and UDP packets. The ``BF_HOOK_CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR_*`` hooks have no packet to log: use ``log`` alone, and bpfilter will log the process and the address it connects or sends to. See :doc:`../reference/rules` for all the ``log`` options.
