/**
 * @file elfstub.h
 *
 * ELF stubs are a mechanism to integrate clang-compiled BPF bytecode into
 * bpfilter-generated BPF programs. Complex logic is more easily implemented
 * in C and integrated into the final program that developed in BPF bytecode
 * directly.
 *
 * ELF stubs source code is part of bpfilter's sources, they are compiled
 * using clang, the ELF file is stored in a C array and accessible to the
 * daemon at runtime.
 *
 * **Creating a new ELF stub**
 *
 * 1. Add a new source file for the BPF program in the daemon's codebase (in the
 *    `bpf` folder, as `$NAME.bpf.c`).
 * 2. Declare the ELF stub in the daemon's CMakeLists.txt (in
 *    `bf_target_add_elfstubs()`).
 * 3. Add a new ID for this stub in `bf_elfstub_id`.
 * 4. Write the BPF C code: define a single function (additional inline
 *    functions and macros are allowed).
 *
 * **Technicalities**
 *
 * At build time, ELF stubs are compiled by clang as BPF program. As such, they
 * are bound to the same limitations as any other BPF program. `xxd` is used to
 * convert the ELF file into a C array (with size), which is included in a
 * generated `rawstubs.h` header file.
 *
 * `rawstubs.h` defines an array of `bf_rawstub` structures containing:
 * - `const void *elf`: pointer to the ELF data.
 * - `size_t len`: size of the ELF file.
 *
 * Each ELF stub can be manipulated through an instance of `bf_rawstub`, all
 * the instances are stored in an array, which is as big as `_BF_ELFSTUB_MAX`.
 *
 * However, the ELF stubs are not accessed directly through the `bf_rawstub`
 * structure, as it's not usable as-is. Instead, the `bf_context` will extract
 * the actual bytecode from the ELF file, and relocate the kfunc calls. During
 * generation, `bf_ctx_get_elfstub` is used to retrieve a pointer to
 * `bf_elfstub` containing the BPF instructions to be copied in the program.
 *
 * **Limitations**
 *
 * Not any BPF program can be integrated into a bpfilter program, this section
 * lists the current set of limitations:
 * - Maps are not supported: BPF maps can be defined, but they are not
 *   integrated by bpfilter into the program, so the final BPF program won't
 *   be verifiable.
 * - Function are not supported: each ELF stub source code should contain a
 *   single function to be integrated. Inline functions are allowed, as they're
 *   not real functions in the final ELF file.
 *
 * Those limitations might evolve, as new BPF features are developed and the ELF
 * stub implementation is improved.
 *
 * While map are not supported, `bpf_printk()` can be used, as bpfilter is
 * able to add the strings to its own map.
