 * Every caller must initialise the library before using any other function,
 * and tear it down when done:
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * int r = bf_ctx_setup(false, "/sys/fs/bpf", 0);
 * if (r < 0)
 *     // handle error
 *
 * // use bf_ruleset_*, bf_chain_*, ...
 *
 * bf_ctx_teardown();
 * @endcode
 *
 * `bf_ctx_setup` and `bf_ctx_teardown` are declared in `<bpfilter/ctx.h>`,
 * which is included by this header. Calling any API function before
 * `bf_ctx_setup` succeeds returns `-EINVAL`.
