/**
 * @file process.h
 *
 * The functions defined in this file are used to manage an external process.
 * They are inspired by the Python `subprocess` module.
 *
 * `bf_test_process` represents the process to manipulate, it must
 * be initialized using `bf_test_process_init()` with the correct command and
 * arguments.
 *
 * `bf_test_process_start()` will fork the current process, and run the
 * pre-defined command in the new thread. Two file descriptors will be available
 * to read the forked process' `stdout` and `stderr` streams (use
 * `bf_test_process_stdout()` and `bf_test_process_stderr()` to do so).
 *
 * The forked process can terminate by itself, in which case you need to wait
 * for it anyway using `bf_test_process_wait()`. You can also kill the process
 * manually by calling `bf_test_process_kill()` to send a `SIGTERM` signal,
 * then calling `bf_test_process_wait()`. The last option is to call
 * `bf_test_process_stop()` which will kill it and wait.
 *
 * Lastly, cleanup the resources allocated for the process with
 * `bf_test_process_clean()`.
