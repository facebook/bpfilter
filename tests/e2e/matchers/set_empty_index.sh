# Regression test for set index mismatch when empty sets precede non-empty sets.
#
# Sets are indexed by position in chain->sets. The matcher payload stores this
# index, which is used by BF_FIXUP_TYPE_SET_MAP_FD to resolve the map fd from
# handle->sets. If _bf_program_load_sets_maps skips empty sets without
# preserving their index slot, subsequent non-empty sets end up at wrong
# positions in handle->sets, causing fixup resolution to fail or resolve the
# wrong map.

# If handle->sets doesn't preserve index correspondence, the fixup for
# set_index=1 will be out of bounds (handle->sets only has 1 entry at
# index 0).
